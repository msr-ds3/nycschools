```{r}

```


### joining data frames for mapping
```{r}

# joining the lat long and school info dfs
lat_long_and_school_info <- inner_join(school_info_join, schools_lat_long, by = c("ats_system_code" = "dbn"))

# join above data frame (lat long for school) with mid to hs and hs to mid dfs

##### middle to high school (mapping what high schools students go to)
mid_to_hs <- inner_join(mid_to_hs, lat_long_and_school_info, by = c("hs_dbn" = "ats_system_code"))
##### high school to middle school (mapping what middle schools students come from)
hs_to_mid <- inner_join(hs_to_mid, lat_long_and_school_info, by =c("mid_dbn" = "ats_system_code"))


```

### mapping mid_to_hs and hs_to_mid to a map of census tracts
```{r}

# load nyc census tracts file = nyc_tracts
load("/data/nycdoe/nyc_tracts.Rdata")

# sample middle school map data
sample_ms_map_data <- mid_to_hs %>% filter(mid_dbn == "10X368" & year == 2014)

sample_ms_map_data %>% group_by(school_census_tract) %>% summarise(count = n())

# sample hs map data
sample_hs_map_data <- hs_to_mid %>% filter(hs_dbn == "01M292", year == 2010)

# middle school map merge
ms_map <- merge(nyc_tracts, sample_ms_map_data, by.x="TRACTCE", by.y = "school_census_tract")

# high school map merge
#hs_map <- merge(nyc_tracts, sample_hs_map_data, by.x="TRACTCE", by.y = "school_census_tract")

```


## creating middle school map
## when a middle school is chosen, the map will show which census tract and which high schools students are going to
```{r}


#palette for plotting map
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "Reds",
                    domain = range(ms_map@data$count, na.rm=T), na.color="transparent")

#create icons for middle and high schools
mid_school_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/buildings-6/90/01-512.png",
  iconWidth = 30, iconHeight = 30

hs_school_icon <- makeIcon(
